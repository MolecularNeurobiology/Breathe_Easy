**Breathe Easy** is a Python and R based software suite that can interrogate 
respiratory waveforms from whole-body plethysmography recordings in an automated
fashion according to quantitative user settings. The program further analyzes the
data using a linear mixed effects model (LMEM) with Tukey post-hoc to test 
for significant differences. Publication-worthy graphs are then generated
with signficiance marks based on these tests automatically added for the user.
