   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. note::
   The required file format for the respiratory recordings is .txt. It is possible to use recording software other than LabChart as long as comments are included that indicate which timestamps belong to which experimental conditions, i.e., room air, 5% CO2, etc.. We use LabChart for all of our recordings, so instructions to convert those recordings are below. For the software you use, please visit the appropriate help website for information on converting the recordings into text files.
