Full Run of SASSI-STAGG
==============================
You can run SASSI-STAGG front to back with no pause in running the code. If this is your first time running data through the pipeline we 
do not recommend using this function as you may find that your data needs slightly more curation or your settings for breath selection 
need to be adjusted. 

1. Ensure input, output location, and all settings files are correctly loaded and that the settings you've selected match the data you are running.

    * For a quick outline of configuration see the :ref:`Quickstart <Quickstart>`. 
    * For more detailed help, follow the complete instructions outlined :ref:`here <Where do I start?>`.

2. Choose parallel processing preference ``button 10`` and image format saving preference ``button 15``. 
3. Select checkbox indicating you want a full run of Breathe easy ``button 11``.
4. Click ``Launch BASSPRO``, ``button 12``.

    .. note::
       This is the same button as would be pressed for a run of just SASSI. The full run is indicated by the checkmark in ``button 11``.
       If this button is not checked, then only SASSI will run.
