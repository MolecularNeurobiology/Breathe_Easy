- Added code comments on all the files.
- Minor adjustments to code structure (purely aesthetic).

Data import:
- Added error handling for creating the tibble.
  - If empty JSON, specific warning printed and file skipped.
  - If incompatible JSON, general warning printed and file skipped.
  - If empty tibble after all files have been added, raises error and stops execution.
