convert_timestamps_to_autosections.py - story/how to use

the software will have a button to create a custom autosections template starting from timestamps in a signal file (the button could be the last entry in the pull down menu, or a seperate button on the autosections subgui)

when selected, the user is prompted to select one or more signal files (fewer signal files will be scanned through faster, but more signal files will more exhaustively confirm the timestamps actually present)

the list of files selected is passed as the argument to the convert_timestamps_to_autosections function.

the function takes a ~few seconds to scan through the selected file, and returns a pandas dataframe.

This data frame should be reminiscent of a dataframe present if the used had opened a preexisting autosettings file. and can be used to replace/populate the contents of the autosettings subgui.

there is no specific means of cancelling the function.
