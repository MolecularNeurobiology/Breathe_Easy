Running STAGG
==============================
Once you have settings configured and input selected, you are ready to run STAGG.

Before launching STAGG, you can indicate whether you want the figures produced to be in .svg format or .jpeg format. 

1. Indicate which file format you would like your figures produced as by clicking the corresponding bubble next to your desired format (15).

    * The .svg image format is lossless and ideal for Adobe Illustrator or publishing purposes. 
    * The .jpeg is smaller and faster to make if you just want to view the data quickly. 
    * The speed difference is negligible for smaller datasets, but for particularly large datasets (100+ mice), opening the QQ plots or Poincare plots can take a considerable amount of time in .svg format, so we recommend jpegs until you want to produce the figures that would be used in a publication.

2. Click the Launch STAGG (16) button.
