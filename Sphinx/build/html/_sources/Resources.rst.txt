Resources
===============
Included in this documentation are some resources to help fill the gap with some of the technology
implemented throughout this pipeline. We have also included a number of resources for understanding 
results that are generated with Breathe Easy. If there are any issues that remain confusing for you, 
as a user, please do submit an issue on our GitHub repository, or email the authors directly so we
can improve our resources library to make Breathe Easy a one-stop-shop for all your plethysmography
analysis needs.
