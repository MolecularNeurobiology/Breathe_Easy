STAGG Output
=================
The expected output of STAGG includes one of each per folder: 

1. the figures for each dependent variable,
2. the figures for any optional graphs or additional models,
3. the environments pre- and post-model creation as .RData files,
4. copies of the STAGG settings files,

and one “StatResults” folder containing:

5. the numerical description of the model and any accompanying inferential statistics, and
6. the residuals and QQ plots for each dependent variable. 

All of these outputs are saved in a single folder for each run of STAGG. Each of these folders is automatically named with the 
format “STAGG_output_CurrentDate_CurrentTime” to allow the user to keep track of each different run they perform with different settings. 
In addition to the timestamps in the folder name, the inclusion of the STAGG settings files allows direct confirmation of the settings 
used to generate the files for each run.
